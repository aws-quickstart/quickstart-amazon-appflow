This Quick Start deployment guide walks you through deploying Amazon AppFlow on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud for unidirectional data synchronization from Salesforce to 	Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) PostgreSQL. This deployment requires extensive knowledge of AWS and Linux administration.
