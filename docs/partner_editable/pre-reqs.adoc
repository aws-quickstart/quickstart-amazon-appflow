=== Prepare for the deployment

=== Prerequisites

* To access Salesforce from Amazon AppFlow, your Salesforce edition must have API access. Salesforce editions, such as Enterprise, Unlimited, Developer, and Performance provide API access, but Professional and Essentials editions do not. Before proceeding, check the latest information about which editions provide API access.
* Naming conventions are strict for objects, so use exact object names. For more information, see https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.object_reference.meta/object_reference/sforce_api_objects_list.htm[Object Reference for Salesforce and Lightning Platform^]. Note that object support may vary across Salesforce editions.
