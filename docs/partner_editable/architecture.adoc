image::../images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans multiple Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** A managed network address translation (NAT) gateway to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
* In the private subnets:
** An Amazon RDS PostgreSQL database.
// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Make sure that the additional components are also represented in the architecture diagram. End each bullet with a period.
* An Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repository to store a Docker image.
* An Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) bucket to store Salesforce object data.
* Lambda functions to transfer Salesforce data to RDS and S3.

[.small]#* The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
